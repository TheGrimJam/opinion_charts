### Prototype of a sentiment analyser

The idea is using text from web scrapers or APIs find the general positive or negative attitude around specific subjects - or in specific places. Mostly acting as a front-end for textblob, bridging it with some web sources.

### Prerequisites

In the extremely unlikely event you'd like to run something in this state:

- Virtual environment with python 3 and the packages listed in /requirements.txt

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv [name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
py manage.py runserver
```
